A github notetaker app built in React.

Made by following a tutorial created by Tyler McGinnis, available from www.tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/

hello-world:

A simple example of updating the DOM using React. A variable is used to store the component, which is then passed to the render method along with the desired node in the DOM.

 The render function within the component construction is in essence a template for the component. The ReactDOM.render method however is the final rendering of the desired components to the DOM. So:

render == 'Captain, my calculations show that this is how the component should look'

ReactDOM.render == 'Make it so, Mr Data'



hello-world-with-states:

State is as it sounds: some state of being that a component is exhibiting at any given moment in time, more techincally speaking this is the internal data store of an object.

child-component:

parent-component:

Work in progress!
